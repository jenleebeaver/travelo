A quick exercise in building a travel app with user sign-in/login and posts based on location. 

Have plans to build out associated comments. An additional feature would be to add news updates in certain location, weather in current_user location and all locations, and use the location gem to pick up the users IP address. Would also like to utilize js in <script> files for changing h1 elements.  

Run thin start --ssl to get the server running.
