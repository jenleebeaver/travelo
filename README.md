A quick exercise in building a travel app with user sign-in/login and posts based on location.

## Project Plans

Build out associated comments. Add news updates in specific location, weather in current_user location and all locations, and use the location gem to pick up the users IP address. Would also like to utilize js in <script> files for changing h1 elements.
